# Smart Cane AI

An AI-powered smart cane system to assist stroke patients during rehabilitation.  
The system monitors gait patterns and helps track recovery or detect deterioration over time.  

## Goals
- Collect gait data from sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.)
- Analyze and classify walking patterns
- Differentiate between healthy and impaired gait
- Provide long-term monitoring for stroke rehabilitation

## Project Structure
- `docs/` → project documentation and research notes  
- `data/` → datasets or dataset links  
- `notebooks/` → experiments and prototyping  
- `src/` → source code for preprocessing and AI models  
- `tests/` → unit and integration tests  

## Next Steps
1. Research available gait datasets  
2. Define clinically relevant gait parameters  
3. Build preprocessing pipeline  
4. Train initial AI model
